  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These quick and easy baked chicken meatballs come out tender, moist, savory, and slightly crispy where browned. Italian seasoning like oregano and basil, as well as garlic, and onion work well together to create a delicious flavor and aroma</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1/3 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup pre-grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound ground chicken breast</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with a rack in the top third position. Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, and lightly grease with 1 tablespoon of the oil.</li>

    <li>Stir together breadcrumbs and milk in a bowl until fully combined. Let stand at room temperature until milk is fully absorbed into breadcrumbs, about 10 minutes. Add Parmesan, Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion powder, granulated garlic, and pepper to the breadcrumb mixture, and stir to combine.
    Breadcrumbs mixed with milk and seasoning in a glass bowl with a spoon </li>

    <li>Mix together chicken, egg, and 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large bowl until combined. Fold breadcrumb mixture into chicken mixture until
    just combined. Place chicken mixture in refrigerator, uncovered, and
    chill until firm, about 10 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Gently shape chicken mixture into 20 (1 1/2-inch balls), and place on the prepared baking sheet leaving a 1-inch space between each meatball. Brush tops and sides of meatballs with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</li> 
    
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes, flipping after 8 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
